# Material and Methods

## Parameter space exploration

We divided our simulations into two scenarios: the first scenario had
exponential decline on speciation rates and constant extinction rates
through time (BVARDCST), whereas the second scenario had constant
speciation rates and exponential increase on extinction rates over
time (BCSTDVAR). For these two scenarios, four parameters were
combined according to each scenario: for BVARDCST, we used two
parameters for speciation rates (initial speciation LAMBDA_0 and
ALPHA) and one parameter for extinction rates – MU. In the second
scenario (BCSTDVAR), we used one parameter for speciation rates
(LAMBDA) and two for extinction rates (initial extinction MU_0 and
BETA). These values were sampled randomly for each of the simulations
(simulation process described below) from uniform distributions
bounded by the values presented in table 1.

## Diversification scenarios and simulations

The simulation process of the 2000 simulated trees for each scenario
consisted of 6 steps, as follows. (1) Parameter values (/lambda,
/alpha, /mu and /beta) were randomly samples from a uniform
distribution with the limits indicated in table 1. (2) The expected
time of the initiation of the decline phase was calculated (t /_ max when
speciation = extinction). We also calculated the expected peak species
diversity at t_max. (3) We then estimated the time necessary for
losing 80% of the peak diversity. The final species diversity values
were forced to lie between 10 and 500 species at the end of the
simulation, due to limitations imposed by working with trees too small
(low statistical power) or too big (high computational memory/time
demand). If the expected final diversity was outside of these limits,
the sampled parameter values were stored and discarded, and steps 1-3
were repeated. The time needed for the species diversity to drop to
80% of peak diversity was obtained by numerical approximation, since
it is not possible to analytically integrate the speciation and
extinction functions. (4) The time calculated in the previous step was
then used in the simulation function. The function is available at
http://github.com/gburin/labmeme/bamm_rpanda, and its initial version
was kindly provided by Dr. Helene Morlon. The function simulates trees
according to time-varying speciation and/or extinction rates, and
stores the full resulting phylogeny that contains both extant and
extinct species. We modified it to limit the maximum total diversity
to 20000 species; if at some point the simulation reached this limit
the simulation was interrupted, the parameters were stored and
discarded and steps 1-4 were repeated; additionally, some simulated
trees went fully extinct before the set time: in this case, the
parameter values were also stored and discarded, and the steps 1-4
were repeated. All parameter combinations (valid, extinct or
“exploded” were stored in separate files, and used to explore the
properties of the parameter space.


After simulating all trees for each scenario, three final steps were
performed. (5) We used the estimated diversity estimates for the whole
life of each simulated tree to calculate, analogous to step 3, the
times needed for the loss of 50% and 20% of peak species
diversity. Furthermore, to check for false positives, we also
calculated the time needed to reach 20% less of peak diversity but
still on the increase phase, were the methods are expected to not
detect decline in diversity. (6) All trees had then their extinct
species pruned to give us the corresponding molecular phylogenies.

## Model fitting and parameter estimation

We used two recently described methods (RPANDA and BAMM) to retrieve
information about speciation and extinction rates for the resulting
molecular trees. RPANDA estimates the parameters of the functions that
describe the variation of speciation and extinction rates through
time, whereas BAMM provides average instantaneous rates for each time
step within the duration of the tree. Both models were thus fitted to
each one of the trees in both scenarios. RPANDA models were fitted
within the R environment, whereas BAMM is coded in python. The two
models provide distinct types of information: while RPANDA returns
parameter estimates for the model(s) one is evaluating, BAMM generates
point mean rate estimates for discrete time intervals along a tree
history. Thus, in order to compare both models, we analyzes only the
initial and final values of the varying rate and of net
diversification as well as the constant rate values.
