# Introduction

Over the past two decades, it is possible to see the rise and
establishment of molecular phylogenies as important information used
to estimate rates of diversification (@Nee1994, Ape, Geiger,
Diversitree, BAMM). The use of those phylogenies have allowed
researchers to evaluate the diversification dynamics of several types
of organisms, and especially have allowed the study of fossil-poor
clades such as birs for instance. However, some skepticism regarding
the extent to which we can rely only on the molecular phylogenies was
raised, due to the very small values of extinction rates commonly
obtained when using only this type of data (@Rabosky2010, @Quental2011)

- Over the last decade researchers are using molecular phylogenies of
  extant lineages to estimate rates of diversification (speciation and
  extinction). Skepticism comes from Rabosky 2010, Quental & Marshall
  2011, due to extinction rates being frequently estimated with very
  small values using molecular phylogenies.
  
	 
- However, according to the fossil record most lineages are already
  extinct and many of them are in a declining phase (examples: canids,
  rhinos, hyena, horses).
  
	 
- Lineages are characterized by an expansion and a decline phase and
  it is still an open question whether we can detect it or not using
  molecular phylogenies (Quental & Marshall 2011 suggest with a simple
  approach – gamma statistics – that it is difficult to distinguish
  between decline and stable diversity; Morlon *et al.* 2011, with more
  sophisticated methods were able to detect decline; but discuss the
  limitation of their results).
   
- However, how general are the results from Morlon *et al.*? Lack of
  papers that have used these methods, and even greater lack of papers
  that actually found decline with these methods.
  
- Curiously BiSSE-like models suggest that some traits might be
  associated with negative diversification rates (Goldberg *et
  al.* 2010, Burin *et al. 2015*, among others).
  
- Additionally, more recently Beaulieau & O'Meara shown by revisiting
  Rabosky's 2010 that extinction rates can be reasonably estimated in
  some scenarios, although these scenarios are limited by not
  including decline in diversification.
  
- New methods (Morlon *et al.* (2011) and Rabosky (2014)) allow for
  extinction to be higher than speciation although none of these two
  methods were tested thoroughly in their capacity of detecting
  declines in different points in time. Liow et al. 2010 show that the
  signature of a given diversity dynamics might change as time goes
  by.
   
- Here we present a broad analysis to compare their ability to detect
  diversity decline in different evolutionary scenarios over different
  viable parameter combinations within a comprehensive parameter
  space. Mention that our aim is not only to assess the potential of
  both methods in estimating the true rates, but also how do both
  perform when evaluating the diversity trajectory over time.
   
- In summary, most of the groups analyzed would still be expanding
which is in disagreement with the trend suggested by the fossil
record.

# Goals

Our goal was to explore the performance of two recently proposed
methods, Morlon *et al.* (2011) and Rabosky (2014) (BAMM) in detecting
diversity declines using molecular phylogenies.


# Material and Methods

## Parameter space exploration

We divided our simulations into two scenarios: the first scenario had
exponential decline on speciation rates and constant extinction rates
through time (BVARDCST), whereas the second scenario had constant
speciation rates and exponential increase on extinction rates over
time (BCSTDVAR). For these two scenarios, four parameters were
combined according to each scenario: for BVARDCST, we used two
parameters for speciation rates (initial speciation $\lambda_0$ and
decaying rate $\alpha$) and one parameter for extinction rates –
$\mu$. In the second scenario (BCSTDVAR), we used one parameter for
speciation rates ($\lambda$) and two for extinction rates (initial
extinction $\mu_0$ and decaying rate $\beta$). These values were
sampled randomly for each of the simulations (simulation process
described below) from uniform distributions bounded by the values
presented in table 1.


## Diversification scenarios and simulations

The simulation process of the 2000 simulated trees for each scenario
consisted of 6 steps, as follows. (1) Parameter values ($\lambda$,
$\alpha$, $\mu$ and $\beta$) were randomly samples from a uniform
distribution with the limits indicated in table 1. (2) The expected
time of the initiation of the decline phase was calculated ($t_{max}$ when
speciation = extinction). We also calculated the expected peak species
diversity at $t_{max}$. (3) We then estimated the time necessary for
losing 80% of the peak diversity. The final species diversity values
were forced to lie between 10 and 500 species at the end of the
simulation, due to limitations imposed by working with trees too small
(low statistical power) or too big (high computational memory/time
demand). If the expected final diversity was outside of these limits,
the sampled parameter values were stored and discarded, and steps 1-3
were repeated. The time needed for the species diversity to drop to
80% of peak diversity was obtained by numerical approximation, since
it is not possible to analytically integrate the speciation and
extinction functions. (4) The time calculated in the previous step was
then used in the simulation function. The function is available at
http://github.com/gburin/labmeme/bamm_rpanda, and its initial version
was kindly provided by Dr. Helene Morlon. The function simulates trees
according to time-varying speciation and/or extinction rates, and
stores the full resulting phylogeny that contains both extant and
extinct species. We modified it to limit the maximum total diversity
to 20000 species; if at some point the simulation reached this limit
the simulation was interrupted, the parameters were stored and
discarded and steps 1-4 were repeated; additionally, some simulated
trees went fully extinct before the set time: in this case, the
parameter values were also stored and discarded, and the steps 1-4
were repeated. All parameter combinations (valid, extinct or
“exploded” were stored in separate files, and used to explore the
properties of the parameter space.

After simulating all trees for each scenario, three final steps were
performed. (5) We used the estimated diversity estimates for the whole
life of each simulated tree to calculate, analogous to step 3, the
times needed for the loss of 50% and 20% of peak species
diversity. Furthermore, to check for false positives, we also
calculated the time needed to reach 20% less of peak diversity but
still on the increase phase, were the methods are expected to not
detect decline in diversity. (6) All trees had then their extinct
species pruned to give us the corresponding molecular phylogenies.

## Model fitting and parameter estimation

We used two recently described methods (RPANDA and BAMM) to retrieve
information about speciation and extinction rates for the resulting
molecular trees. RPANDA estimates the parameters of the functions that
describe the variation of speciation and extinction rates through
time, whereas BAMM provides average instantaneous rates for each time
step within the duration of the tree. Both models were thus fitted to
each one of the trees in both scenarios. RPANDA models were fitted
within the R environment, whereas BAMM is coded in python. The two
models provide distinct types of information: while RPANDA returns
parameter estimates for the model(s) one is evaluating, BAMM generates
point mean rate estimates for discrete time intervals along a tree
history. Thus, in order to compare both models, we analyzes only the
initial and final values of the varying rate and of net
diversification as well as the constant rate values.
